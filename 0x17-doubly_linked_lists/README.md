#0x17. C - Doubly linked lists
A doubly linked list is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes. Each node contains a piece of data and two pointers or references, one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for traversal in both directions: forward and backward.
## 0. Print list 
a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
## 1. List length 
a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.
## 2. Add node
a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
## 3. Add node at the end 
a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
## 4. Free list 
 a function that frees a dlistint_t list.
## 5. Get node at index 
a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
## 6. Sum list 
a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
## 7. Insert at index 
 a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
## 8. Delete at index 
a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
