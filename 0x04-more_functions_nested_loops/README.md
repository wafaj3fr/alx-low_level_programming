# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This is a C language project that contains functions and nested loops.

## 0. isupper

A function that checks for uppercase character.

## 1. isdigit

A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

## 2. Collaboration is multiplication 

A function that multiplies two integers.

## 3. The numbers speak for themselves 

A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

## 4. I believe in numbers and signs 

A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

## 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language 

A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

## 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line 

A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

## 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe 

A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

## 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch 

A function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

## 9. Fizz-Buzz 

The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

## 10. Triangles 

A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.


### advanced 
## 11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic 


This program finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

## 12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper 

A function that prints an integer.
